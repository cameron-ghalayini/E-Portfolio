        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Cameron Ghalayini, and I am currently pursuing my Master of Public Health (MPH) degree with a concentration in Population Health Management at the University of Florida.

        <h2>Applied Practice Experience</h2>
        <p>I am completing my Applied Practice Experience as a legislative fellow in the office of Congressman Darren Soto through the UF Health Cancer Center Cancer Policy Internship Program. In this role, I am involved in legislative support, policy development, and advancing public health policies related to cancer care and health disparities. My internship is an essential part of my MPH degree, allowing me to apply my academic learning to real-world public health challenges.</p>
